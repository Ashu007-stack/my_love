    <h1>Hey titli ❤️</h1>
    <p>
Hey my cutie pie,

I don’t believe in perfection,
but when you smile at me, everything feels perfectly right.

You came into my life quietly,
yet you changed it completely.
In your presence, my heart feels calm, safe, and understood.

I may not have everything,
but I have a heart that chooses you honestly and forever.

If loving you means giving my best every day,
then that’s the kind of perfection I want to live with.

You’re not just someone I love,
you’re someone I want to grow with… always. ❤️

Even when we argue or don’t agree,
my love for you never changes.

Sometimes I get upset, sometimes I react,
but behind every word, my heart still chooses you.

Our fights are never about leaving —
they are about understanding each other better.

Loving you doesn’t mean being perfect,
it means staying, even on the hard days. ❤️
    </p>
